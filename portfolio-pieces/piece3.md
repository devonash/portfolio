title: Disney Quotebook
type: Print
description: The objective was to experiment with type in order to create a themed book of quotes. For my theme I decided to showcase various disney stories in a fun way. I also experimented with type through creating typographic images on the left side of each spread. To continue the theme, a synopsis of the quotationâ€™s disney story was used to fill in the area of each image. In addition the fun theme, die cuts were used on the right side of the spreads in order to create contrast and support the main idea of each quote.
