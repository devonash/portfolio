title: Disney Quotebook
type: Print
description: The objective was to experiment with type in order to create a themed book of quotes. The book was created to showcase various disney stories in a fun way. I experimented with type through creating typographic imagery on the left side of each page. Within that image, a synopsis of the film was placed to go with the quotation on the right sided pages. Die cuts were used on the right in order to create contrast and meaning in the quote to further create interest in the books design.
