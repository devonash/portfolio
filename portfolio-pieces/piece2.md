title: Stop Motion Breakfast
type: Motion
description: This piece was designed because of my love of breakfast food. Everything is made from tactile pieces of paper in the beginning and later turns into something realistic so that it can be eaten. The swiping motions when decision making also create a very similar experience to what people do day to day on their mobile devices. The intended audience was children which is why the colours are very bright and the design is simpler and less busy.
