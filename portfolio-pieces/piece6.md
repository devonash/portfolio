title: Mountaingoat Yoga Logo Re-Design
type: Branding
description: Mountaingoat yoga centre required a logo that was cleaner and that fit the look and feel of their business. To create a calming sensation and relate back to the overall experience in their centre, a lighter grey and blue were used within the design. The mountain goat was maintained by forming a simplified graphic that could be easily understood. An interesting hidden and symbolic feature is the mountain seen in the mountain goats beard.
