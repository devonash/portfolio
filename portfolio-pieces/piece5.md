title: Access Ally App Design
type: UI/UX
description: This app is designed for those who are in wheelchairs or caregivers to those who are. When in a wheelchair, it can be difficult to find areas to spend time in that cater to you and allow you to move freely. Additionally, finding an accessible elevator may also be a problem when buildings are smaller. This is why I created an app to find accessible buildings within a local radius. This would aid people in creating a more comfortable and inclusive experience for everyone. While finding more accessible environments, you will also be able to use the key/barcode feature which allows those who use it to tap for the elevator in place of taking extra time to search for a key.
