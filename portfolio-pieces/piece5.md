title: Accessibility App Design
type: UI/UX
description: This app is designed for those who are in wheelchairs or who are caregivers to those who are. When in a wheelchair, it can be difficult to find areas to spend time in that cater to you and allow you to move freely. Finding an accessible elevator may also be a problem when buildings are smaller. This is why I created an app to find accessible buildings for those in a local radius. An extra feature to this app is the key/barcode which allows those who use it to tap for the elevator in place of searching for a key.
