title: Central Roast Pumpkin Seed Packaging
type: Packaging
description: The goal for this project was to come up with an eco-friendly package design. Central Roast is a brand that often uses plastic to keep their snack mix fresh. In order to create a package that was better for the environment, the design had to eliminate as much plastic as possible. This is why the package is almost entirely made from paper. In order to coordinate with the pumpkin seed theme, a seasonal package design for the fall was created to draw attention on the shelf. In the end, this piece was successful in its structure and design.
